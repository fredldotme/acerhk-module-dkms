Q: The driver works perfectly when using force_series, what is needed to add
autodetection?

A: I need the model name of the laptop, if you do not see a usable name in
/proc/driver/acerhk/info please try the tools dmidecode/biosdecode/vpddecode
to find this name. You can also load the driver and then look into the bios
directly by scanning the memory which is mapped by the driver.

******************************************************************************

Q: I have a (non Acer) notebook which is not recognized by your driver but I
think it should. What information do you need?

A: If it is a non-Acer laptop I would like to know, what makes you think that
your laptop would work with my driver. A windows driver/utility package of the
name "LaunchManager" or "EasyButton" is a good hint. If it is clear that your
hardware is okay, I need the string with your model name from BIOS. Please
don't ask me how to do it. To find out which functions of your laptop the
driver will support, it is best, if you can tell me where to get this
"LaunchManager" or "EasyButton" package.
If it is a model from 2003 or newer then chances are good that it's a dritek
type one. In this case try the option "force_series=6000" to at least enable
the keys.

Q: Why can't I activate my wireless hardware on Acer TM 420/430/6000/8000 ...?

A: On many newer laptops (Dritek type) I do not now how to do this,
sorry. Someone would need to find out how windows does it. Volunteers?

******************************************************************************

Q: I know that wireless hardware is supported on my Aspire 1690/TravelMate4600,
but I cannot get it to work, why?

A: On these model (and similar) the wireless hardware is controlled on two
different levels. One is controlled by acerhk's xxxled file, the other level
is controlled by the key itself. To actually activate the hardware you need to
write '1' to the xxled file and you need to press the corresponding button.
Example:
echo 1 > /proc/driver/acerhk/wirelessled
<if still not working, press Wlan button>

******************************************************************************

Q: Why do I always get 0x00 from /proc/driver/acerhk/key?

A1: Check the type of your laptop if /proc/driver/acerhk/info. If it is
"Dritek", you cannot read the keys from the driver. Starting from version
0.5.17 you get "n/a" out of the key file in this case.
A2: If you have polling enabled (default) you will almost always read 0x00
from this file. This is because in every polling cycle it is checked for key
events and if there is one, it is instantly translated and sent to the kernel
input system. Starting with version 0.5.20 you get "n/a" out of the key file
in this case.

******************************************************************************

Q: When I press a key, nothing happens. Why are they not working?

A: Most keys won't do anything by themself. If nothing happens, that is
because no programm knows what to do with the new keys. You need to assign
actions to them, use the hotkey manager of your desktop to do that. If
using Gnome, you find it under desktop settings - keyboard shortcuts.

******************************************************************************

Q: The driver works for my laptop, but not all of the keys are working. What
can I do?

A: There are some keys/key combinations which generate an ACPI event,
e.g. Fn+F4 on some models or the lid button.
If you have a different laptop than the one which got detected (or you used
"force_series=xxx" anyway), then it is possible that the mapping acerhk uses
to translate the codes from the buttons to key events is wrong.
In this case, load the driver with "verbose=4" and press the buttons which do
not work. Then look for messages from acerhk of the form "translated acer key
code xxx to no key". Note these codes together with the button they belong to
and send me this list along with the model name of your laptop.
If you do not see a usable name in /proc/driver/acerhk/info please try the
tools dmidecode/biosdecode/vpddecode to find this name.

******************************************************************************
Q: I press the wireless key but the hardware doesn't get activated, what's wrong?

A: The driver is only on older models (non-Dritek type) able to read
keypresses by itself and toggle the hardware/LED automatically (with option
autowlan=1). On Dritek type models this must be done by writing the desired
value to one of the wireless files in the proc filesystem. In most
cases this would be /proc/drivers/acerhk/wirelessled to control wlan
hardware (blueled for Bluetooth hardware):

echo 1 > /proc/driver/acerhk/wirelessled

But you could use a hotkey manager to do that automatically when you press the
button. In this case be aware that on some models the button generates
different key events according to the actual state of the wireless hardware.

******************************************************************************

Q: My keys do not work, I only get kernel messages of the form:
atkbd.c: Unknown key pressed (translated set 2, code 0xf4 on isa0060/serio0).
atkbd.c: Use 'setkeycodes e074 <keycode>' to make it known.

A: Press each of the buttons and note the mentioned
code for it (e074 in this example). You should get a list like this:
P1	e074
P2	e075
...
If you are finished with it, look into /usr/include/linux/input.h, using
your favourite text viewer/editor. Search for "KEY_STOP". You should see
the following line in the file:

#define KEY_STOP                128

After it many more lines with equal #defines should be visible. Look for
key names which best match the names of your buttons, e.g. KEY_PROG1,
KEY_WWW and so on. Note the numbers assigned to the names, for KEY_STOP
this would be 128, for KEY_PROG1 148.
Now you have a list with three items per entry, your button, a code
from the kernel messages and a corresponding number from the file
linux.h:
P1	e074	148
P2	e075	149
...
For each line in this list, issue the setkeycodes command as mentioned
in the kernel message:
setkeycodes e074 148
setkeycodes e075 149
...
After doing that, the keys should be available for your hotkey manager.

******************************************************************************

Q: My WLAN hardware gets activated through /proc/driver/acerhk/wirelessled,
but the LED is not working. Why not?

A: Try if adding the option "led=1" to your wireless module helps. For the
ipw2200 driver it works, as Didier CLERC <didier@linuxbourg.ch> found out:

	I have to load the module "ipw2200" with the option "led=1", then
	the wifi button blinks until a network is detected.

******************************************************************************

Q: I have an unsupported laptop, but the driver works when I force the series
to a type like 610 or 2100. Only my buttons doesn't get recognized, why?

A: On models of the type TM_new (like TravelMate 600, 2100 and many other, see
acerhk.c, function setup_model_features for details) the buttons use different
codes on different models. Therefore the driver needs to know these codes. You
can get them if you load the driver with verbose=4, press the buttons and key
combinations (Fn+xx) you are interested in and look for kernel messages of the
form "acerhk: translated acer key code 0xnn to ...". Write down the key code
for each button/key combination and send them to me so I can patch the
driver. I also need your model string to make autodetection work, so include
/proc/driver/acerk/info.
