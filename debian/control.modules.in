Description: acerhk modules for Linux (kernel _KVERS_).
 This package contains the set of loadable kernel modules for the
 acerhk driver.
 .
 This driver will give access to the special keys on notebooks of the
 Acer Travelmate series, which are not handled by the keyboard
 driver.
 .
 It also works on notebooks from other manufacturers (some Medion,
 Fujitsu-Siemens, Compal, Xbook...).
 .
 It also has some other related functionality (depending on the model):
   * controlling LEDs (Mail, Wireless)
   * enable/disable wireless hardware
 .
 This package contains the compiled kernel modules for _KVERS_
 .
 If you have compiled your own kernel, you will most likely need to build
 your own acerhk-modules. The acerhk-source package has been
 provided for use with the Debian's module-assistant or kernel-package
 utilities to produce a version of acerhk-modules for your kernel.
